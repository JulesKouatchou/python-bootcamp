Here are the shell commands that were used to go through the exercise:

$ git checkout -b work
[ Edit indict to add feature, test, "discover" FPR bug ;
  edit bloom.py to fix bug, test, confirm bugfix ;
  edit README to document the new feature and change the version to 2.0. ]
$ git add bloom.py
$ git commit -m "bloom: in retrospect, I distrust the spirit vision"
$ git add indict
$ git add -p README
[ Only stage the documentation part of the changes ]
$ git commit -m "indict: add a '-f' option to print out the false-positive rate" \
         -m "Also document it in README."
$ git commit -a -m "Bump the version to 2.0"
$ git checkout master
$ git merge work
$ git tag v2.0

    This option suppresses output for words that are definitely not
    in the dictionary.

    dictbf.dat.gz: import the filter data into the repo
    
    This way people don't need to recreate the filter data themselves,
    which can be quite time-consuming.

    bloom,importdictdata: move the dictionary-loading stuff out of the generic BloomFilter class
    
    It didn't really belong there and since we need to pre-cache the filter data
    anyway it's not any more useful to have it there.

commit c95e7e65f5f84602ee748ae901a3d7d085e8eb64

    bloom: use "true" division in the module
    
    In Python 2.X, dividing two integers yields the integer floor of
    the result by default: 1 / 2 = 0. Change the module to activate
    "true" division, in which 1 / 2 = 0.5, by the use of a __future__
    import. This only effects only place in the code where we had
    to multiply some numbers by -1. to floatify them; there are other
    places where we relied on the "classic" division behavior but
    used the "//" operator which maintains that behavior even when
    true division is activated. See PEP238 for more context.

    importdictdata,indict: gzip-compress the filter data file
    
    Space isn't a big deal, but Python makes it so easy to do, why not?

commit e825de5bfbe7a917a612e89132fc99518cb09df7
Author: Peter Williams <peter@newton.cx>
Date:   Sun Aug 22 17:32:27 2010 -0700

    Pre-cache the filter data since it takes a long time to compute everything
    
    To accomplish this, we add a new tool, "importdictdata", which fills in the filter
    and saves the state to disk. Then "indict" just loads the prefilled data, which
    is much faster than recomputing it all from scratch.
    
    Now that this is the case, change the desired false-positive rate from 50% to 5%
    when constructing the filter.

    bloom: fix mistake in the name of the __setstate__ function
    
    (This was a real honest-to-god mistake! But if this weren't
    for the demo I'd probably merge this commit into the previous
    one using "git rebase -i HEAD~2".)
